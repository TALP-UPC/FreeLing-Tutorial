## Example 11: Input/Output formats

FreeLing is a library, so its results are stored in data structures and returned to the called application, who is aware of what needs to be done with the results (processed, printed, serialized, etc) and in which format.

However, many applications need to be able to dump and load results of FreeLing analysis, and that is why the library also offers some convenience classes to produce or load usual formats in the NLP community.

In this example, we will see how to use the class `output_conll` to dump FreeLing analysis into a column format similar to that of CoNLL shared tasks.
This module has the advantatge of being configurable, so we can decide which columns and in which order the output is going to consist of.

We are going to use [*Example 9*](example09.md) as a starting point, and simply remove the `ProcessSentences` function and call the output handler to print the analysis instead. 

First, make sure to include the output handler classes:
```C++
#include "freeling/output/output_conll.h"
```

And in [*Example 9*](example09.md), remove function `ProcessSentences`, and instead of calling it after the analysis are completed, use the code:
```C++
// Create output handler and select desired output
freeling::io::output_conll out(L"out.cfg");
// print analysis results in conll format
out.PrintResults(wcout,ls);
```

That will create the output handler instance, and call it to print the results of the analysis.

### Example

Assuming the input file contains the following sentences:

    The big cat eats fresh fish. My neighbour's dog chased the cat.
    The dog is eating meat. Some mice were hunted by the cat.

And if the file `out.cfg` contains, for instance:
```XML
<Type>
conll
</Type>
<Columns>
ID FORM LEMMA TAG DEPHEAD DEPREL SRL
</Columns>
```

we would obtain the output:

```

We can customize the output at will, selecting different columns, or altering the order in which they are printed.

For instance, with this content for `out.cfg`:
```XML
<Type>
conll
</Type>
<Columns>
ID TAG LEMMA SENSE DEPHEAD DEPREL FORM SPAN_BEGIN SPAN_END
</Columns>
```

We would get the output below:

### Remarks

It is important to note that the CoNLL-like output produced by the class `output_conll` can be loaded again into FreeLing by the class `input_conll` instantiated with the same configuration file. The input handler will return a list of sentences with the same content than the original dumped data structures. 

So, this pair of I/O handlers can be used as a way to serialize/deserialize FreeLing data structures to store them to disk, or to send them to other processes using FreeLing in a multi-process application. 

Also, FreeLing provides other output handlers that can dump the produced analysis to formats such as XML, json, or NAF.
