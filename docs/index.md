# FreeLing Tutorial

This tutorial presents some examples of how to use FreeLing main classes for simple language processing objectives.

The goal of this tutorial is not covering all FreeLing possibilities, but get you started with the library.  
Once you understand the basics, you are encouraged to inspect further modules and devise your own ways to exploit FreeLing capabilities.
