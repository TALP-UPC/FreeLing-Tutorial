# FreeLing Tutorial

This tutorial presents some examples of how to use FreeLing main classes for simple language processing objectives.

[FreeLing](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling) is a library oriented to developers providing natural language analysis services.

The goal of this tutorial is not covering all FreeLing possibilities, but get you started with the library.  
Once you understand the basics, you are encouraged to inspect further modules and devise your own ways to exploit FreeLing capabilities.

Once you get how the library works and is structured, you can find more information in the [User Manual](https://freeling-user-manual.readthedocs.io), and in the [Technical Reference Manual](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/doc/refman).

The online readable version of this tutorial can be found at [ReadTheDocs](https://freeling-tutorial.readthedocs.io). The source code (markdown) of the book is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing-Tutorial.git).
